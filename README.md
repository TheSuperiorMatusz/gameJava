# Java Battle Simulator Project

Welcome to the Java Battle Simulator Project! This project serves as a showcase of my Java programming skills, specifically highlighting my proficiency in testing using JUnit and the implementation of design patterns such as the Decorator pattern and a simple linked list.

## Project Overview

The Java Battle Simulator Project is designed to demonstrate the application of various Java concepts and best practices in a practical setting. The primary focus areas include:

1. **Battle Simulation:**
   The project includes a battle simulation component where various entities engage in simulated battles. This showcases the use of object-oriented principles, encapsulation, and inheritance in a dynamic and interactive manner.

2. **JUnit Testing:**
   Rigorous testing is an integral part of this project, emphasizing my commitment to producing reliable and error-free code. JUnit tests have been meticulously crafted to ensure the correctness and robustness of the implemented functionalities.

3. **Decorator Pattern:**
   The Decorator pattern is employed to extend the behavior of entities within the battle simulation dynamically. This design pattern enhances flexibility and maintainability, allowing for the easy addition of new features without modifying existing code.

4. **Simple Linked List:**
   A basic implementation of a singly linked list is integrated into the project to demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts. This serves as an example of my ability to design and implement core algorithms and data structures.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the Java Battle Simulator Project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Java and a compatible IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
 Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Running the Project

    Locate the main entry point (e.g., Main.java) and run the application.

    Explore the battle simulation, review the JUnit tests, and examine the implementation of the Decorator pattern and the simple linked list.
